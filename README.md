# Bitesize AuthZ Webhook

## Installation

`bitesize-authz-webhook` is packaged into docker container and can be found at
`geribatai/bitesize-authz-webhook`. We do not push a 'latest' container so reference the version number.
Currently it does not support HTTPS termination, so it is advised to run it behind HTTPS proxy.

## Configuration

- `/etc/kubernetes/authz-webhook/webhook.yaml`
```
clusters:
  - name: authz
    cluster:
      server: http://127.0.0.1:8888
current-context: webhook
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: authz
  name: webhook
```

- `/etc/kubernetes/authz-webhook/rules.hcl`
```
# see rules.hcl in examples
```

## Kubernetes configuration

### API server config

```
  --authorization-webhook-config-file=/etc/kubernetes/authz-webhook/webhook.yaml
  --authorization-mode=Webhook
```

  namespace: kube-system

    image: geribatai/bitesize-authz-webhook:${VERSION}
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8888
      hostPort: 8888
    volumeMounts:

      mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/authz-webhook
      readOnly: true
    env:

      value: /etc/kubernetes/authz-webhook/rules.hcl
  volumes:
  - name: config
    hostPath:
      path: /etc/kubernetes/authz-webhook
```

### Environment variables

* `LISTEN_PORT` - Port webhook listens requests on (Default: 8080)
* `RULES_CONFIG` - path to `rules.hcl` file. (Default: rules.hcl in current
directory).

### rules.hcl

Access rules are described in HCL format. Rules file is processed from the top,
and the first rule match found is returned as authorization status. If no match
is found, implicit deny rule is matched at the end.

```
access "allow" {
    user = "admin"
}

access "deny" {
    verb = "create"
}
```

Additional examples can be found in `examples` directory.


## Changelog

* 0.0.5 - First open-source release. Supports HCL rules.
